## Basic usage:

have the w2.py in the same work folder
(or)
use jupyter notebook

```
# make a separate python file, and play around with importing,
# what happens when you just import w2?
# or try out 'from w2 import LineMultiplication'? what about using 'as' keyword?

import w2
va = w2.LineMultiplication(2,4)

```
